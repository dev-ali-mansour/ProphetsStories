## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers of this project pledge to make participation in our community a
respectful, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone.

We commit to ensuring a positive environment based on mutual respect and cooperation, regardless of
background, level of experience, or personal beliefs.

## Our Standards

- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Personal attacks or insults
- Harassment or discriminatory remarks

## Our Values

We maintain our values and beliefs in a respectful manner and expect all participants to respect the
project's cultural and ethical guidelines.

As maintainers, we adhere to our faith-based principles and do not endorse ideologies or behaviors
that conflict with our core values.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are
expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable
behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions that do not

requests, and other interactions—and in public spaces when an individual is representing the
project.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project
team.

Maintainers reserve the right to remove individuals from the community or revoke access if
violations persist.
